# ## Introduction
# This tutorial shows how to set up and run Mandel's consolidation problem based
# on the Biot equations of poroelasticity.
# 
# Other [examples](https://github.com/pmgbergen/porepy/tree/develop/examples) can be run in a similar fashion.

# ## Mandel's problem
# 
# Unlike the general poromechanical model provided in PorePy that considers a compressible
# fluid, Mandel's problem follows the Biot equations, which is based on the assumption
# of slight fluid compressibility.
# 
# The mixer class for this verification is therefore based on the derived model class
# `BiotPoromechanics` (see `porepy.models.derived_models.biot`), a subclass of
# the full poromechanical model `Poromechanics` (see `porepy.models.poromechanics`).
# 
# Let us first import the mixer class `MandelSetup`:

# In[1]:


import sys
from pathlib import Path
import porepy as pp

sys.path.append(str(Path().absolute().parent))
from examples.mandel_biot import MandelSetup


# Now, it is simply a matter of setting up the model parameters. In this example, we
# will use real physical parameters. For the user's convenience, the `mandel_biot.py`
# module contains suggested physical constants for the fluid and the solid (the same
# physical parameters employed in [3]).
# 
# Let's import them:

# In[2]:


from examples.mandel_biot import mandel_fluid_constants, mandel_solid_constants


# and set the model parameters:

# In[3]:


# Set material constants
material_constants = {
    "solid": pp.SolidConstants(mandel_solid_constants),
    "fluid": pp.FluidConstants(mandel_fluid_constants),
}

# Set scaling
scaling = {"m": 1e-3}
units = pp.Units(**scaling)

# Create time manager
time_manager = pp.TimeManager(
    schedule=[0, 2e1, 1e2, 1e3, 5e3, 1e4],  # [s]
    dt_init=20,  # [s]
    constant_dt=True,  # [s]
)

# Set mesh size (only mesh_size_bound is used).
ls = 1 / units.m  # length scaling
mesh_arguments = {"cell_size": 5.0 * ls}

# Create model params
params = {
    "material_constants": material_constants,
    "meshing_arguments": mesh_arguments,
    "time_manager": time_manager,
    "plot_results": True,
    "units": units,
}


# Note that we introduced a length scaling via the `pp.Units` class, where we specify a
# factor of `1e-3`, thus effectively measuring length in _millimeters_. Defining a
# properly scaled problem can have positive consequences for the conditioning of the
# linear system. Note that other base magnitudes can also be scaled analogously.
# 
# Finally, let's run the verification setup:

# In[4]:


setup = MandelSetup(params=params)
pp.run_time_dependent_model(model=setup, params=params)


# In the plots from above, the solid lines represent the exact solutions and the dots
# the numerical approximations obtained with MPSA/MPFA-FV. Each line corresponds to a
# scheduled time, with $\tau$ denoting the dimensionless time.
# 
# The last plot shows the degree of consolidation (a dimensionless quantity measuring
# the state of consolidation of the soil) as a function of time.
